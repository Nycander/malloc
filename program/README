This directory contains a suite of seven tests to be used for checking your
implementation of malloc routines.

The file sysmalloc.o has been extracted from the the system's standard
library. You can compare the performance of your malloc implementation
against the system's one.

The Makefile can be used directly to compile and generate all seven
binaries. The name of your file should be "malloc.c". Note that
compilation is done using GNU's C compiler. You can also use any other
ANSI compiler.

The script RUN_TESTS runs all seven tests. Normally, a test should
take a few seconds to complete.

Have fun!
